## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to practice what I have learned so far in context of the Udemy online course.

In this challenge I combined my skills on how to make dynamic changes using DOM manipulation as well as targeting JS elements using Jquery.

The Simon game is the exciting electronic game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order. It's fast-paced play, with lights and sounds that can challenge you. Experience the fun as you repeat the patterns and advance to higher levels.

## Features


- Each of the pads lights up and plays a tone. The game is basically a memory game. Simon lights one of the coloured pads and sounds a tone, then two, then three, etc. Players attempt to match Simon by pressing the pads in the proper sequence.
